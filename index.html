								<p><b>Alex Bobby</b> S3717978</p>
								<p>I was born in India and moved to Australia in 2011. I lived in NSW for about 2 months and moved to melbourne. English being my second language I had troubles making friends in high school but having gaming as a common factor between the students I was able to meet couple of people. I’ve had to change high school every 2 years because of renting and buying a house so made a lot friends throughout. My interest in computers started at a very young age because of games and knowing a bit about computers I was the ‘IT guy’ of the family. I haven't had any work experience in an IT industry but I am interested in cyber security and game development. </p>
								<p><b>Harrison Schonfelder</b>s3722929</p>
								<p>My Father was born in Germany and moved to Australia when he was 19. I live in Surrey Hills and attended Xavier College where I grew an interest in computers. In my spare time I enjoy going to the gym, working at McDonalds and Woolworths, and playing AFL and basketball. I am currently saving to travel Europe and study abroad in Canada or Germany. I hope to attain employment  in Cybersecurity at the end of my degree. I am an AFL and MCC member and enjoy going to 15-20 AFL games a season.  </p>
								<p><b>Dayeon Kim</b> S3739905</p>
								<p>I’m exchange student from KAIST, Republic of Korea. After graduating science high school, I entered university and chose computer science as my major. I like swimming and traveling, also I enjoy going to delicious restaurants. What I am most interested in is a methodology for more efficient and accurate design of conversational user interface related to artificial intelligence. I’ve worked for R&D programmer short-time intern at CMES inc, which is the 3D image scanning and machine vision company in Korea.</p>
								<p><b>Aiden Perona</b> S3539619 aperona.github.io </p>
								<p>I was born and raised in Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. I attended Shepparton High School. I grew up on an orchard so there wasn't much to do nearby, leading me to take an interest in computers. After graduating from high school I worked to a couple years to finance my University, enrolling into a Bachelor of IT. In my spare time I like to play video games, watch movies, practice music or learn new skills. </p>
								<p><b>Seah Soon Kitz</b> S3665432 nickseah.github.io/MyProfile.github.io/</p>
								<p>I am a Malaysian Chinese who grew up in Malaysia. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Business Management at RMIT University. I am able to speak four languages which are English, Malay, Chinese and Cantonese, it is a norm in my country to speak that many languages because there are many different races in Malaysia.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/job.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Aiden Perona</p>
								<p>The ideal job that I selected in assignment 1 was a java programmer. According to the Burning Glass data the position of java developer 7th most advertised position, meaning that it is in quite high demand. 
The IT related skills required for this position would most importantly be JAVA and Javascript then followed by other skills such as building relationships, Microsoft Windows, technical support, graphic design, SQL and so on.  Overall these jobs are ranked as SQL being the most important, followed by JavaScript, JAVA, Microsoft Windows, building relationships, graphic design and technical support respectively. 
The general skills required for this position can be just as important as the technical skills when it comes to obtaining and retaining a position at a company, I would have to demonstrate skills such as; communication skills, organising, problem solving, teamwork, creativity and so on. These skills rank in importance according to the burning glass data beginning with communication skills at number 1, followed by; problem solving, organising, teamwork and creativity respectively.
The 3 highest listed IT related skills that I did not list as required for my position are project management, business management and SAT.  
The 3 highest listed general skills that I did not list as required for my position are writing, planning and detail oriented.
After looking at the Burning Glass data I have come to the conclusion that I would still suit this job after I have gained the necessary technical knowledge and I believe that I already display a majority of the requirements within the general skills section.</p>
								<p>Dayeon Kim</p>
								<p>The ideal job that I chose in assignment 1 was a AI s/w engineer. According to  the Top IT Job Titles of Burning Glass data(March 2018), software engineer is the 11th most high selection. The IT-specific skills for the software engineer would include most of the computer and programming language skills such as JAVA, Project Management, Technical Support, LINUX, Software Engineering, Git and Systems Engineering. Those skills are all highly ranked and considered as important skills in IT industry as shown in Top IT skills of Burning Glass Data(March 2018). The general skills required would be Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Organisational Skills, Team Work, Planning, Creativity, Research, and Time Management. They are essential to the implementation of a high-quality project. In addition, communication and relationships are also essential because most of the recent projects are realized as a team. All of above skills are highly ranked according to the Top Generic Skills of Burning Glass Data(March 2018). The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my required skill set are SQL, JavaScript, and Microsoft Windows. But they are the basic knowledge of being IT professional, so I couldn’t ignore the importance of them. The three highest ranked general skills which are not in my required skill set are Writing, Troubleshooting, and Detail-Orientated. After having looked at the Burning Glass data, I could get more information about my job, and I became more confident. I realized that I needed to work harder to become a person with the new knowledge and generic skills I needed for my job.</p>
								<p>Seah Soon Kitz</p>
								<p>my ideal job that I have chosen is to be an Advertising manager. There is no data that I can compare to from the Burning Glass Data but the closest job that I could compare to is that of a graphic designer/desktop publisher which is ranked 7th in the top Burning Glass Occupations. The IT skills needed for this position would mainly be project management which is the 5th most demanded skill and Graphic Design which is the 10th most demanded skill. The general skills required would be communication skills and problem solving skills which are ranked 1st and 2nd respectively followed by other skills such as team work/collaboration, creativity and planning to further retain my position as an advertising manager. The top IT skills which are SQL, Javascript and JAVA are not needed in my required skill sets because in the advertising/marketing field, the more important IT skills would be Project Management, Graphic Design, and Business Management, these skills would definitely aid me in carrying out tasks in this particular field; as opposed to the top three IT skills which would not be that much of assistance. The three highest ranked general skills are organisational skills, writing, and troubleshooting which are not required in my skill set. I believe that these skills are still important but not as important as communication, problem-solving and team work skills which would definitely be an advantage for my field. Having looked at the Burning Glass Data, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed because I feel that I already have the necessary general and IT skills to be able to retain this job.</p>
								<p>Harrison Schonfelder</p>
								<p>As I chose a graduate position as my ideal as a foundation for a career in information technology, the presumed knowledge is that of a tertiary education in Information Technology or a related field. This graduate program tries to give you a broad range of experiences to continue your career in your chosen IT specialty. As it is Woolworths retail experience is highly sought after as it provides a foundation for both interpersonal, communication skills, teamwork and collaboration, time management and problem solving. Thus, not only Woolworths IT sector, but all hiring IT businesses would look favorably upon retail experience. The three most highly ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my required skill set are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. I am familiar with these skills but Woolworths graduate IT program does not require extensive knowledge of it. The three most highly ranked generic skills which I did not list are writing, creative and troubleshooting. No, as I have not completely figured out I want to do and hence, why I believe a graduate program is a good foundational step towards a career in Information Technology.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Group Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pi.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Project Idea is for a Smart Digital Alarm Clock that is Essentially an extension of a phone combined with a USB charger. Integrating several 								commonly available modules, a Raspberry Pi, Camera, Microphone, Speakers, 5VDC Power supply, Back-up Battery contactless charging pad, and 									Passive IR sensor to allow the user to perform all the roles that may need from an Alarm clock.</p> 

								<p>Functions:</p>
								<p>General Alarm Clock (displays time and such),</p>
								<p>Controllable via a network app or self-hosted website</p>
								<p>Detects when the user gets out and stays out of bed to prevent them over sleeping and disables the alarm without user intervention.</p>
								<p>Charges devices plugged into or resting on top of it.</p>
								<p>Secure against all virtual intrusion</p>
								<p>Integrates with external wearable sensors to wake the user during their optimal wake time. Giving the user a better waking experience.</p>
								<p>Integrates with other home automation and Smart-home experiences. Such as Alexa, Google Home, Cortana, etc. Control lighting/blinds 									depending a schedule, user requests or other inputs.  </p>
								<p>Integrated Speakers for playing music.</p>
								<p>External Display Support via HDMI allowing display on a TV or Monitor for Media PC or Chromecast like experience. Or Display can be used to 									show other information that may be requested but less efficient to give via sound such as news, weather, financial data, etc.</p>
								<p>Recognise Official Alerts such as Bush fire warnings, evacuation orders, and similar to alert Users ASAP to such regardless of the time of 									day or their alert status.</p>
								<p>Battery-Back-up for core functionality (not Charging devices) incase of power failure. </p>

								<p>The Challenge for the group with this project would be writing and integrating all the software packages that are available to do all the 									functions but that may be written in different languages and with different intentions in mind. Given the availability of hardware relating to 									Raspberry PIs and the relative simplicity of this projects hardware we do not expect much of a problem there, unless the Pi proves insufficient 								to the processing needs of the software for the above functions which may either require us replacing it with a more powerful Single Board 									Computer or ditching some of the resource intensive functions.</p>
